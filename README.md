# WÃ¼stner Lab Calcium analysis tool

## Installation
The tool requires a few basic Python packages that can be installed with pip or conda.  
From this directory, you can install all the required packages specified in requirements.txt using the command below.  
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Then you can launch the GUI with ``python gui.pyw``

## Meta-data files
It is advised to create a meta-data file for your videos. This is required if you want to split the video
at specific frames. 
By default, the program will look for ``myvideo.json`` when processing a video file called ``myvido.nd2``
Here's is an example of a config file, where the splits occur at frame 150 and 250.
```json
{
  "Name": "Astrocyte CTRL TG GPN",
  "Specimen": "AstCtrl137",
  "Date": "01-05-2024",
  "Description": "Astrocyte control cell exposed to TG and GPN",
  "Splits": [
    150,
    250
  ]
}
```
